- Cross-platform compatibility

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Performance Issues
- Occasional frame rate drops in complex WebGL scenes
- Memory usage gradually increases during extended operation
- Scene loading can cause temporary stuttering

### User Experience Issues
- Hand cursor may lag in low-light conditions
- Countdown interface requires precise hand positioning
- Scene transitions can be abrupt without proper timing

### Technical Limitations
- Limited to 2 hands maximum
- Requires good lighting conditions
- No gesture recognition beyond basic pointing
- Single camera input only

## Development Notes

### Code Quality
- Follow single responsibility principle for Python classes
- Maintain consistent coding style across all files
- Use proper error handling and logging
- Keep offline operation as priority

### Testing Strategy
- Test all features with virtual environment activated
- Verify performance under various lighting conditions
- Validate error recovery mechanisms
- Test extended operation scenarios

### Deployment Considerations
- Ensure all dependencies are local and offline-capable
- Test installation process on clean M4 Mac Mini
- Verify LaunchAgent configuration for auto-start
- Document troubleshooting procedures

## Session Planning

### Next Session Focus
1. Review and complete performance optimization tasks
2. Implement robust error handling and recovery
3. Create production deployment automation
4. Conduct comprehensive testing

### Future Session Ideas
- Advanced gesture recognition implementation
- Remote monitoring dashboard development
- Scene configuration interface creation
- Multi-language support addition

## Task Completion Guidelines

### Marking Tasks Complete
- Task must be fully implemented and tested
- Code must be committed to version control
- Documentation must be updated if applicable
- Performance impact must be evaluated

### Adding New Tasks
- Break down complex features into smaller tasks
- Assign appropriate priority levels
- Include acceptance criteria
- Estimate effort and dependencies

### Task Dependencies
- Core functionality before advanced features
- Performance optimization before production deployment
- Error handling before unattended operation
- Testing before release
